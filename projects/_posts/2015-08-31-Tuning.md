One of the “black arts” of data mining is setting 
the tuning parameters that control the miner. 
We offer a simple, automatic, and very effective
 method for finding those tunings.

Contrary to our prior expectations, finding these
tunings was remarkably simple: it only required tens,
not thousands, of attempts to obtain very good results.
For example, when learning software defect predictors,
this method can quickly find tunings that alter detection
precision from 2% to 98%.

Given that (1) the improvements are so large, and
(2) the tuningis so simple, these results prompt 
for a change to standard methods in software analytics.
At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to
just run a data miner and present the result without 
conducting a tuning optimization study. The implication
for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue.
