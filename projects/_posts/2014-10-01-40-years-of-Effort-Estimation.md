The longevity of parametric effort estimation is
remarkable. Decades after their invention, these
methods are still both widely used and widely
useful.

This research reviews the standard criticisms of this
approach. We find that, contrary to common
criticisms, (1) parametric estimation has not been
superseded by more recent estimation methods; (2) it
is not true that parametric estimation is no better
than simplistic lines of code counts; (3) the old
parametric calibration data is still relevant to
more recent projects; (4) parametric estimation need
not be expensive to deploy at some new site since
these these methods can be tuned on very small
sample sizes (in our experiments, a mere eight
projects is enough); and (5) compared to other
methods, parametric estimation is not unduly
sensitive to errors in the size estimates.

Hence we conclude that, in 2015, is still valid and
recommended practice to try parametric estimation
before exploring other, more innovative
methods. Also, it can be useful to augment
parametric estimation with (a) some local
calibration and (b) some column pruning (examples of
those techniques are discussed in this research).
