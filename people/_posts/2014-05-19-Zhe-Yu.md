Ph.D student in the Department of Computer Science at North Carolina State University. 
He is now focusing on applying machine learning and data mining algorithms to assist systematic literature review (SLR). The ultimate goal of this project is to reduce the cost of conducting an SLR study to even days of work and thus SLR studies can be conducted much more frequently and easily. He is supervised by Dr. Timothy Menzies.
