	<h2>RAISE Reading Group</h2>
	<p>Here at the RAISE reading group, we explore synergies between AI and software engineering.  To that end, we conduct a weekly interest group for software engineers and developers at NC State. At meeting, we  read trending papers every week on AI +  SE.</p>
	<p>We also have free pizza!</p>

<h3>Next week's paper (August 16th, 2017)</h3>
<h4>
	<a href="https://goo.gl/zVJIxN" target="_blank">Automatically finding patches using genetic programming</a>
</h4>
<p>
	<h5>Automatic program repair has been a longstanding goal
in software engineering, yet debugging remains a largely
manual process. We introduce a fully automated method
for locating and repairing bugs in software. The approach
works on off-the-shelf legacy applications and does not require
formal specifications, program annotations or special
coding practices. Once a program fault is discovered, an
extended form of genetic programming is used to evolve program
variants until one is found that both retains required
functionality and also avoids the defect in question. Standard
test cases are used to exercise the fault and to encode
program requirements. After a successful repair has been
discovered, it is minimized using structural differencing algorithms
and delta debugging. We describe the proposed
method and report experimental results demonstrating that
it can successfully repair ten different C programs totaling
		63,000 lines in under 200 seconds, on average.</h5></p>
