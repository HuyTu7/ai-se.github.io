	<b>Abstract:</b> Cloud computing provides engineers or scientists promising platforms to run complex computing tasks. For scientific workflows, a.k.a. data-intensive workflows, seeking a proper deployment configuration into some cloud environment is not easy. Traditional workflow scheduling algorithms were based on some heuristics, e.g. reliability greedy, cost greedy, cost-time balancing, etc., or more recently, the meta-heuristic methods, such as genetic algorithms. These methods are very slow and not suitable for rescheduling in dynamic cloud environment. This paper introduces RIOT (Randomized  Instance Order Types), a stochastic based method for workflow scheduling. RIOT groups the tasks in the workflow into virtual machines via a probability model and then uses an effective surrogate based method to assess large amount of potential schedulings. Experiments in dozens of study cases showed that RIOT  executes tens of times faster than traditional methods and results of RIOT is comparable, or even better in most of study cases.
