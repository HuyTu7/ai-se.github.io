	<h2>RAISE Reading Group</h2>
	<p>We conduct a weekly interest group for software engineers and developers at NC State. We read trending papers every week in software engineering in order to discover which have enough intellectual meat, which are the most interesting and canonical papers for a given topic, which topics are interesting but insufficiently covered in the literature, and so on...</p>
	<p>We also have free pizza!</p>
