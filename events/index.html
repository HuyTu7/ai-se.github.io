		System failures resulting from configuration errors are one of the major reasons for the compromised
reliability of today’s software systems. Although many techniques have been proposed for configuration error
detection, these approaches can generally only be applied after an error has occurred. Proactively verifying
configuration files is a challenging problem, because 1) software configurations are typically written in poorly
structured and untyped “languages”, and 2) specifying rules for configuration verification is challenging in
practice. This paper presents ConfigV, a verification framework for general software configurations. Our
framework works as follows: in the pre-processing stage, we first automatically derive a specification. Once we
have a specification, we check if a given configuration file adheres to that specification. The process of learning
a specification works through three steps. First, ConfigV parses a training set of configuration files (not
necessarily all correct) into a well-structured and probabilistically-typed intermediate representation. Second,
based on the association rule learning algorithm, ConfigV learns rules from these intermediate representations.
These rules establish relationships between the keywords appearing in the files. Finally, ConfigV employs
rule graph analysis to refine the resulting rules. ConfigV is capable of detecting various configuration errors,
including ordering errors, integer correlation errors, type errors, and missing entry errors. We evaluated
ConfigV by verifying public configuration files on GitHub, and we show that ConfigV can detect known
configuration errors in these files.
