In the RAISE reading group, we explore synergies between AI and software engineering. To that end, we conduct a weekly interest group for software engineers and developers at NC State. At meeting, we read trending papers every week on AI + SE. To get upcoming schedules of our reading group, please visit [this page](http://ai4se.net/events/). The reading group is open to the public and free pizza will be provided.
