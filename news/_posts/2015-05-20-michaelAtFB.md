The world is a big social place. What can we learn from it?

So says [George Mathew](http://georgevmathew.com/), masters student and founding member of the NC State's RAISE lab. 

Goerge is spending his sumemr working at Facebook, in San Francisco, checking out the hitech big data scene. Look for him on Facebook (cause truth to tell, he might be looking at you already).

Come home soon George, we want to learn all we can from your industrial work.
