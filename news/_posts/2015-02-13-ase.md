## Analytics Without Tuning Considered Harmful?

_Submitted to ASE'15_

One of the “black arts” of data mining is setting the tuning parameters that control the miner. We offer a simple, automatic, and very effective method for finding those tunings. For the purposes of learning software defect predictors this method can quickly find good tunings that dramatically change the performance of a learner. For example, in this paper we show tunings that alter detection precision from 2% to 98%.

These results prompt for a change to standard methods in software analytics. At least for defect prediction, it is no longer enough to just run a data miner and present the result without conducting a tuning optimization study. The implications for other kinds of analytics is now an open and pressing issue.
