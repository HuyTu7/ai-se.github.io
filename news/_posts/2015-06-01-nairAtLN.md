Industrial big data is interesting, confusing, intricated and fascinating.

So says [Vivek Nair](http://vivekaxl.branded.me/), NC State CS Ph.D. student now spending summer at LexisNexis, Atlanta. 

No, he can't tell us what he'll be doing there (nondisclosure agreements). What we do know is that he has been assigned to a team developing new tools for LN's HPCC ECL tool suite. Which means that every day he'll be working on thousands of cores and terabytes of data.

Will he ever come home to us? Time will tell.
