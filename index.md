title: Exploring AI and SE synergies 
layout: page
---

The NcState iSERL research lab explores the synergy between AI and
software engineering.

+ As SE is asked to answer
  dynamic automated, adaptive, and/or large scale
  demands, other computer science disciplines come to
  play. AI is one of them that may bring SE to further
  heights.
+ Conversely, SE can also play role to
  alleviate development costs and the development
  effort associated with AI tools.

So iSERL explores AI for SE applications as well as
SE for AI applications.
