The AI-for-SE lab is a research laboratory at the
North Carolina State University, Department of
Computer Science.

This lab is focused on the synergy between AI and
software engineering.  As SE is asked to answer
dynamic automated, adaptive, and/or large scale
demands, other computer science disciplines come to
play. AI is one of them that may bring SE to further
heights. Conversely, SE can also play role to
alleviate development costs and the development
effort associated with AI tools.
