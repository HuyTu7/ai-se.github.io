title: Exploring AI and SE synergies 
layout: page
---

The NcState RAISE research lab explores the synergy between AI and
software engineering.

+ As SE is asked to answer
  dynamic automated, adaptive, and/or large scale
  demands, other computer science disciplines come to
  play. AI is one of them that may bring SE to further
  heights.
+ Conversely, SE can also play role to
  alleviate development costs and the development
  effort associated with AI tools.

So researchers at RAISE apply AI to SE applications (as well as
applying SE to AI).
